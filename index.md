Hey there and welcome to my private collection of small projects and ressources. 
For a brief introduction: I am a data specialist employed at an asset manager for private markets. For most of my time, I apply various data analytics techniques to solve problems. Typical tasks include forecasting various measures, extracting sensible information from different sources of data and presenting the results to different audiences. My curated link of online resources might give you a good idea about my daily tasks and general interests: [(link)](/overview_other/)

I am keen to discuss any topics. Feel free to drop me a message anytime: lang_philipp(@)outlook.com
