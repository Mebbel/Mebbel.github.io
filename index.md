Learning is an endless yet fulfilling journey. 
In todayâ€™s world, technical progress produces knowledge faster than before. 
To be on top of a specific topic takes lifelong study. New topics, niches and trends appear steadily. 
If you have missed a trend it is a long and hard way to get to the knowledge frontier. 
But not trying to get there is equivalent to giving up. Yet giving up is out of question.

I will update this blog regularly with posts of my progress and new analyses. Feel free to follow and comment.
