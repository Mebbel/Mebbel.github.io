Driven by passion for data and new technologies, I am determined to constantly extend my knowledge and gain new experiences. I see data, technology and analysis tools as key to the future of companies. Democratizing data technology and sharing analysis tools across a company will determine the success.

In the course of gaining a masterâ€™s degree in economics at the LMU in Munich, I discovered my dedication to data analysis. Contributing to policy consulting at the ifo institute, I observed the power and impact of studies backed by data and sound statistics.

At the department of methodology in a software company (RSU), I extended my knowledge in statistical programming and improved my abilities to produce clean, efficient and version-controlled code. As project leader, I arranged and executed project plans in close communication with customers and the management. 
I specified necessary changes to existing and new software products. Throughout the implementation, I accompanied the IT-department with explaining the methodologies, specifying necessary tests and approving the final product.

During my time in Alternative Asset Management (Golding) I improved my abilities to withstand constant time-pressure, efficiently manage high workloads and quickly adapt to changing requirements. With persistence, I convinced departments reluctant to change, to adapt to new technologies resulting in significant efficiency gains.

I advanced my experiences in analyzing and predicting on manually input data. The data was incomplete, messy and under constant revision. An automation of workflows and an introduction of a thorough quality management were key in ensuring a high quality of forecasts. Introducing these methods allowed me to significantly reduce errors, easily scale analyses and to deliver results in time despite last-minute changes.  

Being self-employed, I became more innovative and creative in finding new ideas and skills to market to potential clients. My resilience to rejection grew and I learned to self-reflect and take different perspectives to grow.

With me, you will gain a highly motivated addition to your team. I strive to inspire colleagues to keep up with me and grow with each challenge. I look forward to getting to know everything about your ideas for your company's future and discuss with you how we will achieve these.
